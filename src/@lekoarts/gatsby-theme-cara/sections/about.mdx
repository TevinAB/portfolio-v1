    I started coding as a hobbyist game dev around 2016, it was something I fell
    in love with immediately. For a while, I thought I was drawn to making
    games, but in reality what I really loved was solving problems with code;
    writing code is something that is intrinsically rewarding for me.

    One of my beliefs is that the journey of a developer is never ending, the
    only constant being change. As a result, I'm constantly looking for ways to
    improve my approach to solving problems, which has fostered an open mindset
    and a willingness to be taught.

    When I'm not doing anything code related; I enjoy listening to music,
    watching sci-fi movies, watching football, or hanging out with family.
